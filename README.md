# Wordlist-Maker
Wordlist Maker Tool made using Python
This makes all possible combinations of the password using the clues already known about it (i.e. The first letter is capital and the rest are lowercase)

# Not Perfect
I guess the code could be simplified, but it works so I ain't touching it.
Note that the longer the password is, the longer it takes to make the wordlist
